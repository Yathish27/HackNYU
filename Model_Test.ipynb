        "    \"Dear Students, This is your confirmation that you re all set for the Spring 2025 Internship Fair on Wednesday, February 12th at the Kimmel Center! Your confirmed time slot is: 1:40 PM - 2:55 PM Reminders: Line-up begins 30 minutes before your slot. You will be given a colored wristband when you arrive to check in at the fair. You ll have 75 minutes to make a great impression. Plan your time wisely to maximize your interactions across both floors. Avoid coats, backpacks or large bags since there will be no coat check.  Quick Tips:Perfect your pitch: State your name clearly and have a concise pitch ready about your skills and goals. Discuss how your expertise aligns with the company's needs. Rather than preparing full 60-90 second pitches, plan on a brief introduction, a short conversation that may occur in a group of students. Be Prepared: Make sure you ve done advance research to determine which companies at the fair will be hiring for roles you re qualified for.   Don t throw your resume at recruiters: Politely offer your resume if it naturally arises in the conversation.  Ask thoughtful questions: Show you ve done your research ahead of time and avoid questions that cover basic company information. Avoid dominating the conversation: Keep conversations brief and allow others to interact with the recruiter. Thank the recruiter: Express appreciation for their time and ask for contact information for follow-up.\",\n",
